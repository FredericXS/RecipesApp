  <img src="Screenshots/Recipe.png" width="250"/>
</div>

## Simple to use
You can view recipes, create your owns, favorite recipes and delete them.

## What versions does this support?
Any version on iOS 16.0+

## How can I download this?
* Download the .ipa file on Releases and install on your iPhone.  
OR
* Clone the project and open in Xcode, and build this in your iPhone.

## Warns
* This is just a demo app and I didn't used databases, so the new recipes created will disappear after close the app

## Credits
* I improved the base-app that I created following [DesingCode Turorial](https://youtu.be/uSanD_pFwis)
